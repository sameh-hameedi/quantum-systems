Code to simulate the Schrodinger equation with wavepacket initial conditions in a one-dimensional lattice subjected to a time-harmonic magnetic potential. The effective dynamics of the wavepacket are described by a Dirac equation.

Use the run.py file to simulate both the Schrodinger and Dirac dynamics and see how they match up.
